TODO LIST:
1. Clean up code a bit. Still a lot that can be optimized
2. Add in computer skills segment with the progress bars attached
3. work on making the site relative functionally on different screen sizes
    * have nav panel hide inside a drop down fixed button when in mobile view.
4. New Profile Photo for page
5. Clean up the XP section and tailor it for Software engineering skills
6. Align the Nav panel bars to the sections on the right. Optimally id like them to stay compressed until you reach their sections. 
    Aka - sticky within a certain height range so that you always know where you are on the page while in that view.

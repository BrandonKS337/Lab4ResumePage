                    who never stops absorbing anything and everything around him to improve himself. I have been in a
                    myriad
                    of other careers/jobs and am now finally starting to follow a passion for coding and development
                    that I
                    know will lead to amazing things in the future. I earned my Bachelors degree from the University of
                    Louisiana Lafayette in 2014 and have now returned to further my scope of knowledge with ULL and the
                    Institute of Data. I have an extremely easy going attitude and a fierce persistance to succeed even
                    at
                    menial tasks which has never failed me so far. I am driven to find a long term career in coding that
                    will both help further my personal goals as well as lead me to developing things that generally will
                    help others further theirs in some way as well. My belief is that technology if done right can help
                    even
                    those stubborn enough to ignore it. So why not put things out there that are able to speak for
                    themselves to such a point that even the non-believers in digital mediums will be drawn to dive into
                    the
                    content we as developers provide.</p>
